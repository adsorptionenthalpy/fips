# Abstract
This FIP allows for creation of fungible and non-fungible tokens on the FIO blockchain. The fio.assets contract will be defined to be as simple as possible carrying out most basic functions to create and transfer user defined tokens.

After the creation, fungible tokens will be mintable to the target user, transferrable and burnable. 
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) follow the same convention, only they are created with a uniform resource identifier (URI) that allow the creator to attach metadata to each NFT. This is typically used to point to an off-chain location like a hosted json to describe additional resources for the assets. This URI can be changed by the appropriately permissioned signing accounts.

Creating a new asset is the only action with a parameter that requires whole value units excluding the decimal amounts. Otherwise, it is expected all actions will utilize the smallest units in 9 decimals. As a baseline, users cannot create new assets on the FIO chain unless the the signing account posesses a valid FIO domain and address.
Creating an NFT automatically creates an NFT signature on behalf of the address of the signing account.

All fungible tokens minted on the FIO chain carry 9 decimal places.

As assets are user generated on the fio.assets contract rather than individual contracts created by users like other platforms, all assets contain a unique ID in table in the place of where one would expect a contract address. This also means multiple assets can have the same symbol, but their legitimacy must be verified by their unique ID retrieved from the FIOASSETS table.  

Any new account receiving custom assets will be able to initiate asset transfers utilizing the bundles that are offered to the user at no cost, paid for by the distributor of the asset. 

Utilizing bundles allow for transferring assets from users who may not have any FIO to cover fees, a viable alternative to most platforms that still require paying variable chain fees to users that may not want to or cannot pay/convert funds to participate in a token, NFT campaign, product, game etc.

# Rationale
TBD

# Implementation
TBD

# Backwards Compatibility
No changes to existing actions.

# Future considerations
fio.escrow contract can be updated in the future to allow for the wrapping of new user-defined assets that can be wrapped onto other networks, such as polygon, ethereum.
